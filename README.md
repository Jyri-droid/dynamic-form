# dynamic-form
A dynamic form for multiple name input. With tag and input field linking and use of WAI-ARIA for screenreaders. The information is picked from the input fields upon save of data, so the user can edit the contents and order without restrictions.
The purpose is to combine learning accessibility-related code alongside my studies on UX accessibility.
It's still WIP, and here are next steps:
* Form row validation needs to be fixed
* Empty rows should disappear upon save of data
* Alignment issues upon change of focus
